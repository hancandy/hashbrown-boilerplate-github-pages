        text: "## One loser\n\nI started with an easy way to find a loser with the assumption of hostility in the game. To be able to end the game, I thought of encouraging players to push for one single player to lose the game, and that could be done by assessing the current situation and grouping with strong players to boycott one player. I imagined that there will be a lot of tension, strategies, lies and betrayal, which could be common in several TV game shows. But we decided that it is not the experience we want to create, and that we want the players to still be able to be friends when the game is over.\n\nTherefore we tried to look into natural ways to determine a loser, where individual player has no intention of making one player lose, it just happens that there will be a loser. One of them is making a racing game, where the loser will be the last to reach the goal. However, this would mean the the winners have to wait after they have won, for a loser to be found. It is also very unpleasant experience for the loser to keep feeling left behind, and experience continuous fail. It is also an experience we do not want to create\n\nWe then got inspired by the statement \"we don't have to win, we just need to not lose\", and thought of the concept of limited space or resource. The first idea was that 4 players fight for 3 vacancies in a party, or the opportunity to date a girl. From this the idea evolved into university space because it is convincing real life situation where we are not trying to be the best, but to be better than some others. When we think about that students probably don't have a strong focus to be strategic as they are buried in their study, we realised parents, who have a clearer view of the big picture, would be more likely to be thinking strategically. They are the ones that \"control\". Who likes to control the most? Tiger moms.\n\n## Resource management\n\nSo how do tiger moms control, and what can increase the kids' chance to go to? That would be our main resource in the game. We decided to focus on what the moms can make their kids do instead what they themselves can do (e.g. Bribing school personnel) because we want to stay within the topic and focus on tiger moms' attempts to control their kids.\n\nWe imagined that the kids need to go to a admission test by the end of the summer(end game)to get into university(goal), and thus have to improve their knowledge before the test (gameplay). To improve academic skills (supplementing goal), the kids need to go to summer school(moves), which takes time and money (resources).\n\n## Iterations\n\n### Planning\n\nAfter the idea generation I drew a basic version. I drew a board with spaces for leisure, basic courses, special courses, work, play and sleep. Time is represented by tokens that briefly represent 8 hours and each turn is a week. I had a really hard time calculating how much money is needed. I tried to make an absolute skill requirement for 3 possible university space, base on that i calculate how much money is needed to achieve.To add some complexity, I put in some special courses,they are more expensive, but gives more experience points. I imagined that players lay all the tokens and end his turn.\n\n### First iteration\n\nWhen we meet again, we decided to try out the plan I made, but before we could start trying the game, some rules needed to be decided. Players laying all these time tokens in one turn would be cause very long waiting time and a huge advantage for the player that starts. In the end we agreed on the suggestion that player should lay 2 tokens in a turn. We also decided that the total number of rounds should be product of 4,and players take turn starting the round. This would ensure that every player has equal amount of times where they can start. My original thought about play and sleep being two different options were that one relates to the happiness of the child and the other one related to the health, but we agreed that it should be combined because having them separated does not provide much in terms of gameplay, they are very similar limitation in the sense that player should have a certain amount of tokens spend in them to be free from the risk of punishment. When a player doesn't put enough tokens to sleep/play, they will have to roll a die to determine whether the child authority would find out and take away the kid. If they do, the player cannot make any move for one round.\n\nIn our first playthrough, we found that even though we aim to shoot for a specific one of the three place available in university, the admission score we get for all these subjects are similar. Also, the special subjects seem to be a bad investment for a player to make because it is expensive and doesn't count that much in the final score calculation. It also caught our attention that all players have similar scores and the winner also wins by just a little bit, at the same time we felt like there isn't much diversity of strategies.\n\nIt took us some time to calculate the final score and it was confusing to some of us, but we agreed that it fits well with the theme of the game: it's like real university admission, and the tiger moms need to work to get what's best for their kids! We think that he calculation is actually part of the game.\n\n### Second iteration\n\nConcerning the problem with special course, we thought of a few ideas, and the one where they give special ability/advantage was most interesting because not only can it provide incentives to invest in those course, it also solve the problem of lacking strategies diversity in the game. It always make sense that they cost more, when they have a special function in the game instead of just being one of the other subjects that will be calculated in the score.\n\nAfter the adjustment, we found that the game requires so many experience points to be held by players, and it would mean that the game requires a lot of pieces(cards or tokens) for experience points. A suggestion was to let the player level up when have some certain experience points, but it could be hard to keep track of what level one's in, as there are so many subjects. Inspired by the Settlers from Catan - Expansion a team member has brought, we used a similar board to keep track of the levels, players only need to flip a card when they level up which is easy to implement and save materials at the same time.\n\nOverworking the child became an unpopular strategy in our playthrough as soon as the players learn that the risk of doing so is so high compared to how much extra one can get out of it. Therefore we decided that it has to be changed, the option of overworking the child should involve risk, but also need to align with the reward. So instead of not allowing the player to move for one round, they just don't get any experience point for two of the tokens they placed. If they put more token required in sleep, they get a chance to earn more experience points from the token they placed.\n\n### Third iteration\n\nAfter another playthrough the game is more dynamic, but the score statistics in the end are still quite similar, and we thought it was because we have the same amount of income and we have fair chance of being the first to make a turn. We thought of solving with problem with adding more randomness and luck elements. Therefore we added chances cards, where unexpected good/bad events could happen to players. We made sure to include some that changes the player's income to add more variety in the gameplay. Actually we decided to put quite a lot of the same income increase card in the deck so that it's more likely for all players to get one of them earlier or later, we think this is important so players won't feel very unlucky or have too much of an income gap with other players.\n\nIn the last playthrough we had we played two rounds and different players won in the two rounds. After adding the luck card the statistics start to vary a bit more, but it doesn't mean the riches player would always win, if the player has a very equal distribution of investment between the three subjects she can actually lose to poorer players who bet on and focus their investment in one particular subject. We haven't fully explored the possibilities with just two playthrough but we felt at that point that the game is playable, pleasurable and at least not obviously unbalanced."
