        text: "<h2 id=\"one-loser\">One loser</h2>\n\n<h3>Blood and flesh</h3>\n\n<p>The discussion started with a TV game shows inspired idea to find a loser with the assumption of competitiveness and hostility. Players can evaluate the situation and make alliance with the strong players to boycott one and force her to be the loser.&nbsp;Such setup invovles&nbsp;a lot of tension, strategies, lies and betrayal. The problem is, these shows are mostly made for the viewer&#39;s entertainment and not thet players. We decided that it is not the experience we want to create,we want to have most focus on the social aspect of the play experience and we want players to still be able to be friends when the game is over</p>\n\n<h3>Keeping your hands clean</h3>\n\n<p>Therefore we tried to look into natural ways to determine a loser, where individual players have no intention of making one player lose, but it just happens naturally. One of the ideas was making racing game, where the loser will be the last to reach the goal. However, this would mean the the winners have to wait after they have won for a loser to be found. It is also a very unpleasant experience for the loser to keep feeling left behind, experiencing stress and continuous failure.</p>\n\n<p>We then got inspired by the statement &quot;we don&#39;t have to win, we just need to not lose&quot;, and thought of the using limited space or resources to determine a loser. The first idea was that 4 players fight for 3 vacancies in a party, or the opportunity to date a girl. This evolved into university space because it is a more convincing real life situation where we are not trying to be the best, but to be better than some others. When we think about that students probably don&#39;t have a strong focus to be strategic as they are buried in their studies, we realised that parents, who have a clearer view of the big picture, would be more likely to be thinking strategically. They are the ones that can &quot;control&quot;. Who likes to control the most? Tiger moms. With the semiotics of the game, we can provide an opportunity for self expression through our rules and mechanics.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"resource-management\">Resource management</h2>\n\n<p>So how do tiger moms control, and what can increase the child&#39;s chance? That would be our main resource in the game. We decided to focus on what the moms can make their kids do instead of what they themselves can do (e.g. bribing school personnel, having an affair with the principal) because we want to stay within the topic and focus on tiger moms&#39; attempts to control their kids.</p>\n\n<p>The context&nbsp;is that the children need to go to an admission test by the end of the summer (end game) to get into university (goal), and thus have to improve their knowledge before the test (procedure of action). To improve academic skills (supplementing goal), the children&nbsp;need to go to summer school (moves), which takes time and money (resources).</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"tiger-mom-board.png\" src=\"//kimberlyliu.com/itu-portfolio/media/b84ef8d1eaac34cc0f423d9a5876fbb3be12fb01/tiger-mom-board.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>The schedule board of the game</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"iterations\">Planning</h2>\n\n<p>After the idea generation I drew a board with spaces for leisure, basic courses, special courses, work, play and sleep. Time is represented by tokens that briefly represent 8 hours and each turn is a week. I had a hard time calculating how much money is needed. I tried to make an absolute skill requirement for 3 possible university spaces, and based on that I calculated how much money is needed to fulfil those requirements. To add some complexity, I put in some special courses, they are more expensive, but have higher pay-offs. I imagined that players lay all the tokens in one go and end their turns.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"first-iteration\">First iteration - first step towards balancing</h2>\n\n<p>When we met again, we decided to try out the plan, but before we could start trying the game, some rules needed to be added. Players laying all their time tokens in one turn would cause very long waiting time and a huge advantage for the player that starts the round. In the end we agreed on the suggestion that player should lay 2 tokens in a turn, and a round is ended when all players have placed their time tokens.</p>\n\n<h3>Symmetrical Game</h3>\n\n<p>We designed the game as a Symmetrical Game, all players should be given the same setup and resources. However, the player who starts first in a round has a big strategic advantage because there are more class vacancies. We tackled the problem by setting the total number of rounds to be 8, a product of 4, so every player has same amount of times to start, and thus equal opportunity to win. A too symmetrical game may scare away some competitive players, but since the game has strong social focus instead of competitive focus, we do not consider this a problem.</p>\n\n<h3>Elimiating redundant elements</h3>\n\n<p>We combined the play and sleep slot because they are very similar limitation in the sense that the player should have a certain amount of time tokens spend in them to be free from the risk of punishment. When a player doesn&#39;t put enough tokens to sleep/play, they will have to roll a die to determine whether the child authorities would find out and take away the kid. If they do, the player cannot make any moves for one round.</p>\n\n<h3>Playtest result</h3>\n\n<p>In our first playthrough, we found that even though we aim for a specific one of the three place available in university, the calculated score for admission we get for all these subjects are similar. Also, the special subjects seem to be a bad strategy for a player to make because it is expensive and doesn&#39;t count that much in the final score calculation. It also caught our attention that all players have similar scores and the winner only wins by a little bit, at the same time we felt like there isn&#39;t much diversity of strategies.</p>\n\n<p>It took us some time to calculate the final score and it was confusing to some of us, but we agreed that it fits well with the semiotics of the game: It&#39;s like real university admission, and the tiger moms need to work to get what&#39;s best for their kids! We think that he calculation is actually part of the game.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"second-iteration\">Second iteration</h2>\n\n<h3>Undesirable strategies</h3>\n\n<p>Concerning the problem with special course, we thought of a few ideas, and the one where they give special ability/advantage was most interesting because not only can it provide incentives to invest in those courses, it also solves the problem of lacking strategic diversity in the game. It makes sense that they cost more, when they have a special function in the game instead of just being one of the other subjects that will be calculated in the score.</p>\n\n<p>Overworking the child became an unpopular strategy in our playthrough as soon as the players learn that the risk of doing so is so high compared to how much extra one can get out of it. Therefore we decided fix the risk vs pay-off balance. Instead of not allowing the player to move for one round, they just don&#39;t get any credit point for two of the time tokens they placed. If they put more tokens than required in sleep, they get a chance to earn more credit points from the token they placed.</p>\n\n<h3>New problems arise</h3>\n\n<p>After the adjustment, we relised&nbsp;that the game requires too many credit cards to be held by players, and it requires a lot of credit cards to be in put in the game. A suggestion was to let the player level up when they have some certain experience points, but it could be hard to keep track of what level one&#39;s in, as there are so many subjects. Inspired by the Settlers of Catan - Expansion a team member has brought, we used a similar board to keep track of the levels, players only need to flip a card in the grad sheetwhen they level up which is easy to implement and save materials at the same time.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"third-iteration\">Third iteration</h2>\n\n<h3>Even more dynamics</h3>\n\n<p>After another playthrough we found the game to be more dynamic, but the score statistics in the end are still quite similar, and we thought it was because we have the same amount of income and we have fair chance of being the first to make a turn. We thought of solving with problem with adding more randomness and luck elements. Therefore we added chance cards, where unexpected good/bad events could happen to players. We made sure to include some that changes the player&#39;s income to add more variety in the gameplay. Income increase chance cards can cause Reinforcing Relationship, to mitigate this effect we put quite a lot of the same income increase card in the deck so that it&#39;s more likely for all players to get one of them sooner or later, we think this is important so players won&#39;t feel very unlucky and the income gap will be a bit smaller.</p>\n\n<h3>Calling it a day</h3>\n\n<p>In the last playthrough we had we played two rounds and different players won in the two rounds. After adding the chance cards the statistics start to vary a bit more, but it doesn&#39;t mean the riches player would always win, if the player has a very equal distribution of investment between the three subjects. The player can actually lose to poorer players who focus their investment in one particular subject. We haven&#39;t fully explored the possibilities with just two playthrough but we found no more obvious dominant strategt, we also felt at that point that the game is playable, has a good sense of tension, and not too difficult to learn.</p>\n"
