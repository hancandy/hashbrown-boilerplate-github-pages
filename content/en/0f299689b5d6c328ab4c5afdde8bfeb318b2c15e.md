        text: "## One loser\nI started with an easy way to find a loser with the assumption of hostility in the game. To be able to end the game, I thought of encouraging players to push for one single player to lose the game, and that could be done by assessing the current situation and grouping with strong players to boycott one player. I imagined that there will be a lot of tension, strategies, lies and betrayal, which could be common in several TV game shows. But we decided that it is not the experience we want to create, and that we want the players to still be able to be friends when the game is over.\nTherefore we tried to look into natural ways to determine a loser, where individual player has no intention of making one player lose, it just happens that there will be a loser. One of them is making a racing game, where the loser will be the last to reach the goal. However, this would mean the the winners have to wait after they have won, for a loser to be found. It is also very unpleasant experience for the loser to keep feeling left behind, and experience continuous fail.  It is also an experience we do not want to create\nWe then got inspired by the statement \"we don't have to win, we just need to not lose\", and thought of the concept of limited space or resource. The first idea was that 4 players fight for 3 vacancies in a party, or the opportunity to date a girl. From this the idea evolved into university space because it is convincing real life situation where we are not trying to be the best, but to be better than some others. When we think about that students probably don't have a strong focus to be strategic as they are buried in their study, we realised parents, who have a clearer view of the big picture, would be more likely to be thinking strategically. They are the ones that \"control\". Who likes to control the most? Tiger moms.\n\n## Resource management\nSo how do tiger moms control, and what can increase the kids' chance to go to? That would be our main resource in the game. We decided to focus on what the moms can make their kids do instead what they themselves can do (e.g. Bribing school personnel) because we want to stay within the topic and focus on tiger moms' attempts to control their kids. \nWe imagined that the kids need to go to a admission test by the end of the summer(end game)to get into university(goal), and thus have to improve their knowledge before the test (gameplay). To improve academic skills (supplementing goal), the kids need to go to summer school(moves), which takes time and money (resources). \n\n## Iterations\n### Planning\nAfter the idea generation I drew a basic version. I drew a board with spaces for leisure, basic courses, special courses, work, play and sleep. Time is represented by tokens that briefly represent 8 hours and each turn is a week. I had a really hard time calculating how much money is needed. I tried to make an absolute skill requirement for 3 possible university space, base on that i calculate how much money is needed to achieve.To add some complexity, I put in some special courses,they are more expensive, but gives more experience points. I imagined that players lay all the tokens and end his turn.\n\n### First iteration\n\n### Second iteration\n\n\n\n"
