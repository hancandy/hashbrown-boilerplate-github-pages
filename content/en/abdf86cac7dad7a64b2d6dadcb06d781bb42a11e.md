We first thought of making a playground for parents to participate in their children's play, but worried that it might not be the best occasion for parents to play freely, because they still have to play the role of parents in front of their children and they also have to prioritize taking care of their children over being playful.\n\nA big challenge in making adults play is that they might feel anxious if their playfulness would be perceived negatively by others as being childish, irresponsible, stupid or even inappropriate. We attempt to tackle the problem by providing them with an occasion, a reason that makes it ok to be playful, and a trusted companion to make them feel safe.\n\nIt is a common thinking that some dog owners walk their dog in attempt to socialise romantically with single dog owners. We got some inspiration from this and looked into dog's role in motivating human and promoting certain behaviour.\n\nWe think that dogs are perfect for the role of companion.Through human intervention in dog breeding, the feature of dogs are to a high extent tailored to appeal humans. They also enjoy bonding with humans, and will stay with and follow the human they bond with, unlike cats. To some,the dog's company is just like one of friends or family. Dog also likes to go out and interact with human, in fact, dogs has played the role of motivator in many dog owners life. A responsible dog owner will walk their dog even if they don't feel like it themselves to fulfill the dog's need. For some, dogs are their running partner, giving them a reason to exercise. Very commonly dogs are good at \"making\" human break out of a task and do something not out of their will. E.g. stop working to feed the dog because it is barking.Nevertheless, owning dogs create a common topic for socialising as a shared interest, usually dog owners have a general interest in dogs, not just their own dog, meaning they are interested to know about each other's dog and it can trigger conversations.It is pleasurable to play with dogs as dogs are generally enthusiastic about playing with human and they can be taught to play in different ways that human prefer.\n\n## Why a dog playground?\n\nThe problem is current dog parks are mostly designed for interactions within dogs and within humans: human talks while dogs play with each other and run around. Dogs are now under-stimulated compare to the time where they cooperate or work with human. We want to provide a shared,safe space for humans and dogs to bond and interact through playing. In the playground, every interaction facilities involves both human and dogs.\n\n## The flow in the palyground\n\nMAP\n\nThe pond area, which could be the most interesting part of the playground, is placed in the far end of the entrance to provide people to explore the playground. The tube maze and the squeaky rope walls are integrated pathways connecting different parts of the park. The basket and balls is also possible to be used in a way that visitors can start in one end and ends in another end, leading to another facility.\n\n## Camping?\n\n### Water Sprinklers\n\nTo facilitate visitor traversal across areas, the water tank has a limited capacity and needs a few second of waiting time for it to be refilled and become usable again. This provides an incentive to move on. To further promote movements, lights can be added on the buttons which blinks in a manner that suggest a path.\n\n### Baskets and balls\n\nThe basket throwing game should have several baskets you can throw to, so itâ€™s easier for several people/dogs to use it. The ball trays and basket can also be placed in a way that suggests a path, for example by labelling the basket with levels, promoting visitors to proceed to the next level basket.\n\n### Dog interaction box\n\nTo avoid people using the interaction box for too long, the interaction box can be operated in sessions. A session needs to be activated by human pressing the start button on top of the box, and a session may end after 4 button press by the dog. The session ends with a sound or a \"Thanks for playing\" message.\n\n## Safey concerns\n\nCoupling safety concerns and that face that the playground has some expensive facilities that require maintenance, the entrance to the playground is not free. This ensure that the security staff at the entrance can check the visitors and the dogs, and refuse entrance due to safety concerns.At the entrance of the playground there should some some safety information and disclaimers.\n\n### Dogs\n\nOnly friendly, non-aggressive dogs are welcomed. There will be a greeting, reception area near the entrance of the playground, trained staff member will interact with the dog to see if the dog is suitable to interact with other human and dogs , and since the area will be crowded with other visitors and dogs, dogs that are not well trained/socialised will likely show aggressive behavior due to the stress and anxiety. Aggressive or dangerous dogs will be banned from the playground until they pass a recognised socialising courses and have been checked again.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren should be minimum 6 years old to be allowed to enter. An age where they are able to refrain from very spontaneous movements, can be taught how to behave around dogs. For small children, there can be an designated area for small kids to learn how to interact with dogs with a personnel's presence.\n\n### Emergency\n\nSince the tube maze is closed area, there is a risk that dogs might start up a fight. Therefore we decide to place a few exits throughout the maze, and some emergency button that either sprays water or produce a high pitched sounds to break up dogs.\n\nAround the park there should be emergency phones where personnel can locate the area and get there to help.\n\n## Encouraging human play\n\nWhat dogs can offer"
