We first thought of making a playground for parents to participate in their children&#39;s play, but worried that they will not play freely because they are there as parents, they have to behave in certain ways and they have to prioritise taking care of their children over being playful.</p>\n\n<p>A big challenge in making adults play is that they might feel anxious if their playfulness would be perceived negatively by others as being childish, irresponsible, stupid or even inappropriate. We attempt to tackle the problem by providing them with an occasion, a reason that makes it ok to be playful, and a trusted companion to make them feel safe.</p>\n\n<p>It is often believed that some single dog owners go to dog parks to socialize romantically with other dog owners. We got some inspiration from this and looked into dog&#39;s role in motivating human and promoting certain behaviour.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-play-with-dogs-\">Why play with dogs?</h2>\n\n<p>In short, dogs are good facilitators for human play because they have personal connections with humans, and therefore can motivate human behaviour and trigger their emotions. In fact, one can say that dogs are one of the important toys for humans in this dog playground. Play activities with dogs easily facilitate self expression as one can tell a lot by the way they interact with dogs.</p>\n\n<p>We think that dogs are perfect for the role of companion. Humans decide what feature of dogs are to be kept from breeding, dogs are to a high extent tailored to human taste. They also enjoy bonding with humans, and will stay with and follow the human they bond with, unlike cats. To some, the dog&#39;s company is just like one of friends or family. Dogs also like to go out and interact with humans and this can motivate humans to socialize and be physically active because a responsible dog owner will walk their dog even if they don&#39;t feel like it themselves to fulfill the dog&#39;s need. For some, dogs are their running partner, giving them a reason to exercise. Very commonly dogs are good at &quot;making&quot; humans break out of a task or habit and do something not out of their own will, e.g stop working to feed the dog because it is barking. Nevertheless, owning dogs create a common topic for socialising as a shared interest, usually dog owners have a general interest in dogs, not just their own dog, meaning they are interested to know about each other&#39;s dogs and it can trigger conversations. It is pleasurable to play with dogs as dogs are generally enthusiastic about playing with humans and they can be taught to play in ways that humans prefer.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-a-dog-playground-\">Why a dog playground?</h2>\n\n<p>A problem is currently that dog parks are mostly designed only for interactions within dogs and within humans: human talks while dogs play with each other and run around. Dogs and humans have less bonding activities after we stopped hunting with dogs. We want to provide a shared,safe space for humans and dogs to bond and interact through playing. In the playground, every interaction facilities involves both human and dogs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"promote-flow-in-the-playground\">Promote flow in the playground</h2>\n\n<p>The pond area could be the most interesting part of the park as there are not many pools that allow dogs and human to be in water at the same time. Therefore it is placed in the far end of the entrance to encourage visitors to explore the rest of the playground. The tube maze and the squeaky rope walls are signifyers of the moving direction in the playground .The basket and balls is also possible to be used in a way that visitors can start in one end and ends in another end, leading to another part of the playground.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"camping-\">Camping?</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"water-sprinklers\">Water Sprinklers</h3>\n\n<p>To facilitate visitor traversal across areas, the water tank has a limited capacity and needs a few second of waiting time for it to be refilled and become usable again. This provides an incentive to move on. To further promote movements, lights can be added on the buttons which blinks in a manner that suggest a path.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"baskets-and-balls\">Baskets and balls</h3>\n\n<p>There are several baskets available for several people/dogs to use it at the same time. To promote movements, the ball trays lead to another location so players need to move there to get the ball to continue playing. They could also be labelled with different levels.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dog-interaction-box\">Dog interaction box</h3>\n\n<p>To avoid people using the interaction box for too long, the interaction box can be operated in sessions. A session needs to be activated by human pressing the start button on top of the box, and a session may end after 4 button press by the dog. The session ends with a sound or a &quot;Thanks for playing&quot; message.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"safety-concerns\">Safety concerns</h2>\n\n<p>Coupling safety concerns and maintanence requirements of the playground, the enty to the playground should not be free, guests should be admitted at the entrance. This ensure that the security staff at the entrance can check the visitors and the dogs, and refuse entrance if necessary.At the entrance of the playground there should some some safety information and disclaimers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dogs\">Dogs</h3>\n\n<p>Only friendly, non-aggressive dogs are welcomed. There will be a greeting, reception area near the entrance of the playground,where trained staff member will interact with the dog to see if the dog is safe to interact with unfamiliar human and dogs. Since the area will be crowded with other visitors and dogs, dogs that are not well trained/socialised can be spotted out as will likely show aggressive behavior due to the stress and anxiety. Aggressive or dangerous dogs will be denied entry for the playground until they pass a recognised socialising courses and have been checked again.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"children\">Children</h3>\n\n<p>Children should be minimum 6 years old to be allowed to enter. An age where they are able to refrain from having spontaneous movements and can be taught how to behave around dogs. For small children, there can be an designated area for small kids to learn how to interact with dogs with a personnel&#39;s presence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"emergency\">Emergency</h3>\n\n<p>Since the tube maze is closed area, there is a risk that dogs might start up a fight. Therefore we decide to place a few exits throughout the maze, and some emergency button that either sprays water or produce a high pitched sounds to break up dogs. Around the park there should be emergency phones where personnel can locate the area and get there to help.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"encouraging-human-play\">Encouraging human play</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-dogs-can-offer\">What dogs can offer</h3>\n\n<p>By making signs with catchy phrases and short information throughout the park, we try to communicate the benefits for humans to play with their dogs. For example titles like &quot;your dog walks you&quot; or &quot;your dog keeps you fit and happy&quot;, and information on how dogs can potentially improve lifestyle and social relationship if humans are engaged them. Some facts and cases can be borrowed from the use of dog therapy.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"missions-and-challenges\">Missions and challenges</h3>\n\n<p>We could provide mission suggestions, where humans and dogs have to work together to achieve. For example, in the sprinklers, instructing the dog to attack several visitors passing by. Another example could be include some signs on the interaction box showing what each button does in every round, so the dog owner can guide the dog to press on a specific button. The mission could be to trick the dog, or to let the dog gets 4 dog treats in a row. The machine can also provide feedback in this case whether the mission is accomplished.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"competitions-and-events\">Competitions and events</h3>\n\n<p>Near the entrance and cafe area, there will be TV screens with notice boards. They can facilitate photo competition to encourage people to capture happy moments in the playground. The theme of these competitions promote interaction, one could be &quot;Your dog is enjoying this as much as you are&quot;. Visitors can vote for winners, and the photos or videos could be shared on social media. The screens also allow for the possibility to hold events like gatherings and matches in the playground showing information of the time, theme, and location.</p>\n"
