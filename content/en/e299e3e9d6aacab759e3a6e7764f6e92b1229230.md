We thought of a few games, and found out that the reason for that could be the game gets boring because is too simple, too little possibilities, too predictable and it doesn't take long before all possibilities are tried. Another problem lies in the nature (ontology of the game). We evaluated some games and chosen chess, because it is a popular game that attracts and maintaines a large group of people, but yet fail include the others, especially newcomers. To understand why chess does not appeal to some people, we thought of a few possibilities. It could be that the rules are too complicated, and that the learning experience is unforgiving: players can lose the game in just a few moves, it could be really hard to learn chess by playing with an experienced player. We then looked at what the game experience of chess is. It is a skill based and competitive game (Agon). By adding randomness and luck elements (Alea) to the game, we predict that the game would be more accessible to novice players. To make the game more engaging and appealing to more types of player, we also added Mimicry elements to the game. For the first iteration we made use of a D20 dice inspired by role playing game. We randomly drafted the states for the different chess pieces because we cannot know if the stats are balanced before we have tried it out\n\n## Second iteration\n\nAfter a few play tests we identified some balancing issues. For example, some we found a Dominant Strategy. Even though the player can choose whether to make an attack attempt, there is no real risk in making the move, making this strategy always preferrable. We also found some Super Units, they are overpowered as they are hard to beat and has high attack points. Base on these we adjusted the attack and defend points of game pieces, and added consequence for a failed attack: the chess piece cannot be used in the next round.\n\n## Third iteration\n\nAfter another playthrough we discovered that the consequence for fail attacks is not harsh enough to be effective, so instead we make the chess piece vulnerable for one round instead of freezing its movement. This greatly reduce the risk to make an attack, because one can lose the piece if it fails.\n\n## Fourth iteration\n\nTo add more luck elements and utilize the D20, we decided to add consequences for critical fail and critical success. Due to their rare occurrence, the consequences should be critical. We have considered killing the chess piece immediately in the event of a critical fail, but we think it is too harsh and we prefer a consequence that add some more gameplay and decision making, therefore we decided to let the opponent counter attack. This way the other player can be involved even when it's not their turn, and it adds more tension since it is not certain that the opponent's counter attack will be successful. In critical fail the opponent gets an extra turn, similarly for critical success, the player gets an extra turn. In order to not drag it too long, the player does not start from the beginning of the game loop i.e rolling D6, instead she is limited to the last D6 roll she made. This also limit how drastic the game state is going to change when a player gets a critical success.\n\n## Game Loop\n\n![detailed-gameloop.png](//kimberlyliu.com/itu-portfolio/media/d7c2bed3766923dba43e2f215c82f83169598613/detailed-gameloop.jpg) After these changes, the game loop of Chess Kingdom is much longer than traditional chess, which makes each loop more complicated. However, from our play tests we felt that the pace of the game was actually faster, probably because there is always something happening compare to the long waiting time in traditional chess for the other player to make their turn. Since the punishment of making a wrong move is not as fetal, and that not chee pieces are movable in a turn, players tend to put less time in thinking which piece to move.\n\n## Mechanics\n\nThe most interesting change to the mechanic is still checkmate, which is an important part of the traditional chess, is no longer possible. The player still needs to roll the die to see it the attack is successful to win. In traditional chess, the King piece is an important piece that player should protect and not place in dangerous locations. In Chess kingdom, player can use the King as an attacker as it has high attack points and it's not easy to beat. Also, when an experienced player make a clever attack and it fails, the inexperienced player will become aware of such possibility and may even counter attack in the next round. In normal chess, player either can or cannot move to a particular square, in Chess Kingdom, when an attack fail, the piece will be pushed back to its original position, even though the movement was allowed for the piece.\n\n## Rules\n\nChess is a minimalistic game, there aren't a lot of complicated rules. However, I personally don't think it is easy to learn. In this assignment I played chess the first time, because I only grew up with Chinese Chess, which is very similar but I still don't think the skill is transferable to western chess. I think one of the result for having so few rules is that players need to think about the implied rules in their brain through learning. Technically what these implied rules I am talking about here are not rules, they are allowed in the game, they will just lead to losing the game. Another way to look at it is that having few rules allow more pace for the player to explore the possibilities and strategy to master the game. I think this is particularly important for skill based games as it gives player a sense of achievement. As we altered the game we have certainty removed some of the strategy, and have introduced more rules. One of the method we used to avoid making the rules too overwhelming is to group them and provide aids to remind players of them so players don't have to remember them (having a chess piece stat card). Another way is to try to reuse existing game elements to make rules easier to remember. For example, we make use of the attack point statistics to decide what pieces the player can move after rolling a D6.\n\n## Experience\n\nBy adding more Alea and Mimicry to the game, there are more uncertainty and less planning involved. Since the consequences of mistakes are not so permanent, players can play more carelessly and instinctually which could make the game more fast paced. Players could also play more relaxed as it the game requires less experience and tactical thinking. By bridging the gap between chess veterans and novices, the experience become more open, because more people can play the game\n\n### Alea\n\nWe changed the controller scheme to add more Alea to the game. The use of a D-6 dice to decide which piece a player can move. The D-20 dice decide whether an attack will be successful. This adds a lot of uncertainty in the game,it is harder for experienced chess player to make long term strategic because the results of their actions are uncertain.\n\n### Mimicry\n\nIn chess, every game piece is distinctive, they have different names and movement rules. However, their names and forms do not relate strongly to their functions and roles in the game other than having unrelated movement rules. In our first iteration, we assigned armor and attack points to the game pieces like in role playing games to strengthen the mimicry aspect of the game. For example, a rook has strong defense and weak attack and it aligns with the perception of the functionality of the piece ; knights and queens are good \"attackers\", The mimicry could further be enhanced by giving more background information on the characters explaining why their profiles are the way they are.\n\n### For inexperienced players\n\nAs there are less punishment for mistakes, Chess Kingdom is accessible for new players, from our playtest it shows that inexperienced players lose by less to the experienced player, it is even possible for them to win. Chess Kingdom can also provide a way to learn about chess in a more forgiving way, for example when an experienced player tries a move but fail, inexperienced player can try it too. The game can't be ended as fast as traditional game when played with an experienced player, so the inexperienced players can take their time to learn about the game.\n\n### For experienced players\n\nAlthough not as important, skills in traditional chess still give an advantage to experienced players. In traditional chess it is common to give handicaps to inexperienced player, but many do not prefer that as it might be condescending. It could be easier for them to play with inexperienced players in Chess Kingdom in a more fair way, and I imagine it could be good for parents playing with children, or as an introduction for someone who wants to eventually play traditional chess."
