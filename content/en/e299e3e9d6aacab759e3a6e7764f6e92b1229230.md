We evaluated some games and chose chess, because most of us have tried it and got frustrated with it and eventually stopped. It is interesting to us that while chess maintains interest from a large group of players, it fails to include so many others, especially newcomers.</p>\n\n<p>It could be because the skill gap between exprienced players and new players is too big, and that the learning experience is unforgiving: players can lose the game in just a few moves, it could be really hard to learn chess by playing with an experienced player.</p>\n\n<h2>First iteration&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>We then looked at what the game experience of chess is. It is a skill based and competitive game (Ag<span class=\"fontstyle0\">&otilde;</span>n). By adding randomness and luck elements (Alea) to the game, we predict that the game would be more accessible to novice players.</p>\n\n<p>To make the game more engaging and appealing to more types of players, we also added Mimicry elements to the game. For the first iteration we made use of a D20 dice inspired by role playing games. We randomly drafted the stats for the different chess pieces because we cannot know if the stats are balanced before we have tried it out.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"second-iteration\">Second iteration</h2>\n\n<p>After the first play tests we identified some balancing issues. For example, we found a dominant strategy. Even though the player can choose whether to make an attack attempt, there is no real risk in making the move, making this strategy always preferrable. We also found some super units, which are overpowered as they have high attack points and at the same time hard to beat . Based on these we adjusted the attack and armour points of game pieces, and added consequence for a failed attack, which is that the chess piece cannot be used in the next round.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"third-iteration\">Third iteration</h2>\n\n<p>After another playthrough we discovered that the punishment for fail attacks is not harsh enough to be effective, so instead we make the chess piece vulnerable (amour drop to 0) in the opponent&#39;s turn instead of freezing its movement. This greatly increased the risk in making an attack, because one can lose the piece if the attack fails.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"fourth-iteration\">Fourth iteration</h2>\n\n<p>To add more luck elements and utilize the D20, we decided to add consequences for critical fails and critical successes. Due to their rare occurrence, the consequences should be critical. We have considered killing the chess piece immediately in the event of a critical fail, but we think such a punishment is too harsh and too discouraging, and we prefer a consequence that adds some more gameplay and decision making. Therefore we decided to let the opponent counter attack. This way the other player can be involved even when it&#39;s not their turn, and it adds more tension because of the potential of surprises. For critical success, the player gets an extra turn. In order to not drag the process too long, the player does not start from the beginning of the game loop i.e rolling D6, instead she is limited to the last D6 roll she made. This also limit how drastic the game state is going to change when a player gets a critical success.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"game-loop\">Game Loop</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"detailed-gameloop.png\" src=\"//kimberlyliu.com/itu-portfolio/media/d7c2bed3766923dba43e2f215c82f83169598613/detailed-gameloop.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>After the changes, the game loop of Chess Kingdom is much longer and complicated than traditional chess. However, from our play tests we felt that the pace of the game was actually faster, probably because there is always some actions taken compare to just sitting and thinking in traditional chess. Since the punishment of making a wrong move is not as fetal, and that not chess pieces are movable in a turn, players tend to put less time in planning their moves. The new rules are not so hard to remember either even though it takes a few round to get familiar to&nbsp;the new game loop.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rules\">Rules</h2>\n\n<p>Chess is a minimalistic game: there is only a small set of rules, the mechanics are simple and the control is easy to learn. It has low perceived complexity but deep systemic complexity. In this assignment I was a new player in chess, because I grew up with Chinese Chess, which is very similar but not the same. I felt that it will still take a long time to be able to play the game, even though there aren&#39;t a lot of rules. Difficulty in learning can be one of the results of having a small rule set, because rules also serve as a guideline to player actions, the less there are, the bigger the space it is for player to explore and perform in, resulting in the long time it requires to learn to play the game strategically. A lot of actions are allowed by rules in the game, but they will lead to losing the game, and to new players they might feel like some hidden rules that are hard to explore.</p>\n\n<p>I think this space for exploration is particularly important for skill based games as it gives player a sense of achievement, and they can express themselve and share this acheivement with others. As we altered the game we have have introduced more rules and reduce the space for exploration and strategy to master the game. One of the method we used to avoid making the rules too overwhelming is to group them and provide aids to remind players of them (having a chess piece statistics card). Another way is to try to reuse existing game elements to make rules easier to remember. For example, we make use of the attack point statistics to decide what pieces the player can move after rolling a D6.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"mechanics\">Mechanics</h2>\n\n<p>The most interesting effect on the mechanic is that checkmate, which is an important part of the traditional chess, is no longer possible. Even though the player can take the king with two pieces, she still needs to roll the die to see it the attack is successful to win. In traditional chess, the King piece is an important piece that player should protect and not place in dangerous locations. In Chess Kingdom, players can use the King as an attacker as it has high attack points and it&#39;s not easy to beat. Also, when an experienced player makes a clever attack and it fails, the inexperienced player will become aware of such possibility and may the same move next round. In normal chess, players either can or cannot move to a particular square, in Chess Kingdom, when an attack fails, the piece will be pushed back to its original position, even though the move was allowed by the rules.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"experience\">Experience</h2>\n\n<p>By adding more Alea&nbsp;to the game, there are more uncertainty and less planning involved. Since the consequences of mistakes are not so permanent, players can play more carelessly and instinctually which could make the game more fast paced. Players could also play more relaxed as it the game requires less experience and tactical thinking. By bridging the gap between chess veterans and novices, the game become more open, because more people can play the game.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alea\">Alea</h3>\n\n<p>We changed the controller scheme to add more Alea to the game. The use of a D-6 dice to decide which piece a player can move. The D-20 dice decide whether an attack will be successful. This adds a lot of uncertainty in the game,it is harder for experienced chess player to make long term strategic because the results of their actions are unpredictable.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mimicry\">Mimicry</h3>\n\n<p>In chess, every game piece is distinctive, they have different names and movement rules. However, their names and forms do not relate strongly to their functions and roles in the game . In Chess Kingdom, we assigned armor and attack points to the game pieces like in role playing games to align the chess pieces&#39; form and their function. For example, a rook has strong defense and weak attack ; a knight and queens are good &quot;attackers&quot;.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"for-inexperienced-players\">For inexperienced players</h3>\n\n<p>As there are less punishment for mistakes, Chess Kingdom is accessible for new players, from our playtest it shows that inexperienced players lose by less to the experienced player, it is even possible for them to win. Chess Kingdom can also provide a way to learn about chess in a more forgiving way, because when an experienced player tries a move but fail, inexperienced player can try it too. The game can&#39;t be ended as fast as traditional game when played with an experienced player, so the inexperienced players can take their time to learn about the game.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"for-experienced-players\">For experienced players</h3>\n\n<p>Although not as important, skills in traditional chess still give an advantage to experienced players. In traditional chess it is common to give handicaps to inexperienced player, but many do not prefer that as they find it condescending. It could be easier for them to play with inexperienced players in Chess Kingdom in a more fair way, and I imagine it could be good for parents playing with children, or as an introduction for someone who wants to eventually play traditional chess.</p>\n"
