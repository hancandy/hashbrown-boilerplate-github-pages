        text: "## Stop Playing\n\n### First idea\n\nThe initial idea was \"a game that doesn't want to be play\". When the game is actively stopping the player from playing the game, and the player has to fight to play the game, it creates a game in itself. Education was part of the game idea, through changing the game in an engine level, players can learn about the technical logics involved in making a game and the terms used in an engine. The inspiration came from the many interesting moments I had when I play around in the engine and see some unintended but logical consequences of my action.\n\n### Background\n\nAfter the group forming, my group members are worried about the game being very niche and boring to most people if we use too many technical terms, so we agreed to add some story elements and make it easier to understand. We story we came up with was that the game doesn't want to be player because it is unfinished, but the game designer wants the game to be played and therefore programmed some tools for the player to fight against the game.\n\nMore specifically, we wanted the player to either find all the missing elements and basically try to build the game again, or to unfix a challenge so it can be playable again (e.g. if the game is about fixing a glass, the player needs to break the glass first if the glass is not borken). All these provide a bit of a backward thinking since the player need to know what the game is supposed to be, and then solve the puzzle by making that game work again\n\n### Prototype: game loop\n\nWe then had to decide whether we want the player to fix one game instead of several, and we preferred a ball game as it is easy for the player to know how the game is supposed to be, and what to do to make it playable. We came up with the follow game loop for the prototype:\n\nTry to play the game -> Identify problems->find the fix->make the fix->try to play the game\n\nThe problems could be for example missing gravity/collision of the ball, basket being to small, player being too weak to pick up the ball, ball moving too fast, player jumping too high...etc\n\nIn our playable prototype we made a sample level where player manipulate collision, gravity and scale to get a ball down from a platform, and then shoot it into a basket.\n\n### Taking a detour\n\nWe went a bit off track, when we thought that a sensible story is needed to motivate the player to continue the game. We then try to think of a story to answer the question why that player want to fix the game and how the puzzles relate to each other, while being able to stay within the technical limitation and gameplay limitation. It was really tough, and the one we agreed on in the end was a carnival theme: the games, or the puzzles are all carnival games, the score that player gets serves as a supporting goal, and the prize is an ultimate goal.\n\nHowever, after the feedback we got we realized that the theme and the narrative might not that essential, and its existence limits our exploration of the game mechanics because everything has to make sense in the theme and story context. The amount of work we need to do to convey the theme aesthetically might also be exceeding the scope of the assignment.\n\n## MetaBeta\n\nWhen we decided to remove the narratives, we focused on how to make use of the mechanics we implemented in the technicle prototype. There is no longer limitation that player must get score to reach a final goal in the end of the game, so the levels can stand alone and there is no need to connect them in a story sense, we have more freedom when designing the levels, and the procedure of actions can be more simple and straightforward.\n\nThe game experience has been updated to be more focused on the satisfaction of manipulate their surrounding game objects in a metagame level. The game title is therefore also updated. Base on that we have a new game loop:\n\nOrientation->Find the goal (The door) ->locate the button to activate the door-> find the tool(ball) to activate the door-->activate the door ->reach the door-->proceed to the next area-->Orientation\n\nIt is to noted that the above is the designed game loop, from the play test results we can see that players do not necessarily get through the game loop in the same sequence in the beginning of the game loop, even though we were trying to communicate this sequence in the tutorial levels. Some players prefer to find the ball first, and figure out where the button is afterwards, and some activate the button first without knowing where the door is."
