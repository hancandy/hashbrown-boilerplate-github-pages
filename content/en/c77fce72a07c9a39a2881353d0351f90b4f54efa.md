We agreed on two major understandings of sport, one being physical movement or training, where it can be done by only one person (e.g. running), the other is more socially oriented: a sport should involve social interactions, within a team, with other teams, and with an audience. Taking the features of commonly accepted sport, we decided to make a inter-group sport that requires sensory-motor skill, a sport that is both cooperative, competitive, skill based, spectatable, and involve physical movements. To ensure that players compete on skills instead of luck, we want the game to require precision.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"a-safe-experience\">A safe experience</h3>\n\n<p>As many of us are not very into traditional competitive i<span class=\"fontstyle0\">nter-group</span> sports, we decided to explore how we can make a version that appeals to people who do not enjoy competitive sports. We identified safety as our major design factor as it might be one major reason that this group does not enjoying these sports. It could be too intimidating when other players can get aggressive and they don&#39;t feel safe.</p>\n\n<p>We then considered technologies (materials/equipment) and picked frisbee, because it offers a different interaction experience from a ball. It can change direction, making it harder to predict where it&nbsp;would land, and offer more ways to manuever and trick other players. To make the sport safe, the sport&nbsp;should discourage physical touch and attacks. In our sport, the goalkeeper should catch the frisbee instead of blocking it, and the goal attempts are made by members from the same team, so we predict the throw to be less aggressive than if they were to shoot at the opponent&#39;s goalkeeper. The arena space is divided by team, which means that players will not move in an area where there are opponent team members. This also lowers the risk of physical contact or conflicts. On the arena we included a fast zone between the two teams respective zones to avoid players to enter into direct physical contact. We also wanted the sport to be welcoming and easy to new players, which is important for a new sport to gain player acceptance and willingness to try. We limited ourselves to simple equipment, and low requirements on the arena and number of players. Therefore we decided to make 2 teams of 4 people to play the game, the arena is subsequently relatively small giving a higher chance of players catching the frisbee. All equipment needed is just a frisbee and a court.</p>\n\n<p>Several rules are implemented. Players are not allowed to move after they have gotten the frisbee in hand, this strengthens the requirement of precision as players have to be able to throw the frisbee in positions that are difficult. This rule also promotes strategy, planning and communication with team members in when to pass the frisbee and where they should stand. Players have to throw the frisbee to pass it onto a team member instead of just handing it over. This forces players to exercise their frisbee throwing skill. We added some more rules after playtesting the game, as we discovered confusing situations and conflicts, and it was necessary to make the rules clearer and more fair. For example, players should not block the frisbee when the goalkeeper is serving, because it will give an advantage to the opposing team and it causes conflict. We did another play test and comments are quite positive, testers had a good experience and it wasn&#39;t too physically demanding. They also mentioned that they feel that the game requires higher frisbee skill than they currently have. It would seem that some of the design goals are reached and we started to polish the rules to make it fair and thorough to encounter most frequently happening situations.</p>\n\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cs2bNz3ahg4\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"too-safe-\">Too safe?</h3>\n\n<p>At this point the sport we came up with was a very calm and peaceful peaceful one, as intended: slow paced, discourages aggression and involves limited physical movement and contact. However, because of the reduced risk, we eliminated a great deal of tension and excitement in the player experience.</p>\n\n<p>The attempt to make the game non-aggressive has taken away the tension. Besides that, other design decisions we have made have given us limitations. The small team size has limited strategy making and number of actions in each game, the small arena size has also limited actions and made moves very predictable. Lastly, lack of game equipment has limited the complexity of the game.</p>\n\n<p>While the sport can be good for casual playing and socializing due to its low commitment requirement and easy set up, players who seek risk and danger are excluded. There is also a worry over how spectatable the game would be, when movements are limited.</p>\n\n<p>However, it is worth noting that based on play test responses, the core gameplay (throwing a frisbee for someone to&nbsp;catch&nbsp;it) is pleasurable. The core interaction could be kept to be improved and expanded.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"improvements-where-should-we-go-\">Improvements - where should we go?</h3>\n\n<p>First thing we should look into is whether to keep the player experience, if we were to keep it as a social play experience, the sport could benefit from being seen as a slow, calm, peaceful, social activity. It would be more suitable to be played with social focus, for example as a ice breaking game, a chance to hangout and socialize with others, or in a more formal context,a bit like golf.</p>\n\n<p>The slow speed and low physical requirements in our sport could appeal to those who are not in very good shape. Similar to golf, it can pretty much be a sport people can play their entire life even when in poorer physical conditions. To further strengthen this appeal, the sport could be situated in the nature, making it more relaxing. The game should also be longer, and possibly even less physically demanding, like eliminating the running start in the game.The goalkeeping area can be smaller so the goalkeeper would run less. The sport should also allow for pause and resume so players can take a break when they are tired. Goals or targets could also be added as extra challenges to promote the slow pace by being more skill focused. A final suggestion could be adding freezing mechanic, where players are not allowed to move when a player is making a goal attempt. This would mean that the game is less real time or quick reaction and more about aiming and throwing through obstacles.</p>\n\n<p>However, If we are to make the sport more fast-pace, more similar to football, volleyball and basketball, we should bring back the tension by introducing more actions. Instead of freezing players to save them from running, we could promote more movement by allowing players to be in the same zone once the match has started, and only limit their location when they need to make a goal attempt. The limitation ensures that a player needs to pass the frisbee to a team member when she is too close to the goalkeeper, and with more passes the actions in the arena become more complicated and possibly more exciting to watch. To make the match more intense with more movements, the team size should be bigger (10+) and the arena should also be big enough to provide some distance between players.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"more-on-what-is-sport\">More on what is sport</h3>\n\n<p>After making our prototype, I did some more research on sport and it led me to another perspective. It seems to me that what makes a sport is highly related to people than just the game itself. According to Australian Sports Commission , a sport has to be &quot;generally accepted as being a sport&quot;. Other keywords than the ones I have seen are &quot;shared and known&quot;, &quot;rule customs&quot;. There are also a lot of concerns about the social, economical and cultural impact of sports. There are huge communities in most sports with official organisations controlling and developing the sports, where they determining the rules.</p>\n\n<p>From this viewpoint, more games can be sports, but what is important is whether such games offer enough interest and room for the participants and the public to share and form organisations to develop them into commonly accepted sports. One important factor is spectatorship because it help spreading the game to a larger audience and allows them to share the experience.</p>\n\n<p>With this information, I would imagine that if our sport should be a more golf-like experience, the factor of success to become a commonly accepted sport would be more focused internally among participants, and the sport should provide social, lifestyle and well-being enhancements. On the other hand, if our sport should be more volleyball like, the importance of spectatorship and the mass public is much higher than in golf.</p>\n"
