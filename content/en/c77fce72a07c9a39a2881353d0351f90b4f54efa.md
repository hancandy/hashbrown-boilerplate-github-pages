We came up with that there are two major understanding of sport, one being physical movement or training, where it can be done with only one person (e.g. running), the other one is more socially oriented: a sport should involve social interactions, within a team, with other teams, and with the audience. We then decided to make a sport with both aspects, it should be cooperative, competitive, skill based, spectatable, and involve physical movements because we can all agree that these are the most familiar characteristics of sports. Our goal was to start with what is shared in a lot of sports we could think of: cooperating within a team to shoot an object into a goal before the opposing team does. To ensure that players compete on skills instead of luck, we want the game to require precision. Then we started to think of what makes our sport different from the pre existing ones. As many of us are not very into traditional competitive sports like football, we tried to explore how we can make a sport to appeal to this group, and we identified that some people could find the experience intimidating because other players can get aggressive and they don't feel safe, and therefore it was our ambition to make a safe sport. We then consider technologies (materials in the sport) and picked frisbee, because it offers different interaction experience as a ball. It can change direction, making it harder to predict where the ball would land. So we The sport has two teams with 3 members each: one goalkeeper and two attacker. To get a score, team members have to pass the frisbee to their goalkeeper, which stands opposite to them. We also tried to alter the experience from popular sports like basketball and football by making the players feel more safe, our sport should discourage physical touch and attacks. In our sport, the goalkeeper should catch the frisbee instead of blocking it, and the goal attempts are made by members from the same team, so we predict the throw to be less aggressive than if they were to shoot at opponent's goalkeeper. The arena space is divided by team, which means that players will not move in an area where there are opponent team members. This also lower risk of physical contact or conflicts. On the arena we included a fast zone between the two teams respective zones to avoid players to enter into direct physical contact. We also wanted the sport to be welcoming and easy to new players, which is important as we need player acceptance and willingness to try when we are creating a new sport. We limit ourselves to simple equipment, and low requirement on the arena and number of players. Therefore we decided to make 2 teams of 4 people to play the game, the arena is subsequently relatively small giving a higher chance of player catching the frisbee. All equipment needed is just a frisbee and a court. Several rules are implemented. Players are not allowed to move when they have the frisbee on hand, this strengthens the requirement of precision as players have to be able to throw the frisbee in positions that are difficult. This rule also promote strategy planning and communication with team members in when to pass the frisbee and where they should stand. Players have to throw the frisbee to pass it onto a team member instead of just handing it over. This also promote the exercise of frisbee throwing skill. We added some more rules after playtesting the game, as we discovered confusing situations and conflicts, and it was necessary to make the rules clearer and fair. For example, players should not block the frisbee when the goalkeeper is serving, because it will give an advantage to the opposing team and therefore make the game unbalanced. We did another play test and comments are quite positive,testers had a good experience and it wasn't too physically demanding. They also mentioned that they feel that the game requires higher frisbee skill they currently have. It would seem that some of the design goals are reached and we started to polish the rules to make it fair and thorough to encounter most frequently happening situations.<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cs2bNz3ahg4\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n\nAt this point the sport we came up with is a very calm and peaceful peaceful one, as intended: it is rather slow paced, discourages aggression and involves limited physical movement and contact. However, because of the reduced risk, we eliminated a great deal of tension and excitement in the player experience.\n\nThe attempt to make the game non-aggressive has taken away the tension. Besides that, other design decisions we have made have given us limitations. The small team size has limited strategy making and number of actions in each game, the small arena size ( xm xm )has also limited actions and made moves very predictable. Similarly, lack of game equipment has limited the complexity of the game.\n\nWhile the sport can be good for casual playing and socializing due to its low commitment and easy set up, players who loves action, risk and danger are also excluded. There is also a worry over how spectatable the game would be, when movements are limited.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that based on play test responses, the core gameplay, which means the basic interaction of the sport (throwing a frisbee and catching it) is pleasurable. The sport could be improved with several aspects addressed above.\n\nFirst thing we should look into is whether to keep the player experience, if we were to keep it, the sport could benefit from being seen as a slow, calm, peaceful, social activity. It would be more suitable to be played with social focus, for example as a ice breaking game, a chance to hangout and socialize with others, or in a more formal context,a bit like golf. On top of being a networking sport, golf also has special values.\n\nThe slow speed and low physical requirements in our sport could appeal to those who are not in very good shape. Similar to golf, it can pretty much be a sport one can play their entire life. To further strengthen this appeal, the sport could be situated in the nature, making it more relaxing. The game should also be longer, and possibly even less physically demanding, like eliminating the running in the start of the game, and the time restriction before one needs to pass the frisbee.The goalkeeping area can be smaller so the goalkeeper would run less. The sport should also allow for pause and resume so players can take a break when they are tired. Goals or targets could also be added to promote the slow pace by being more skill focused. A final suggestion could be adding freezing mechanic, where players are not allowed to move when a player is making a goal attempt. This would mean that the game is less real time or quick reaction and more about aiming and throwing through obstacles.\n\nHowever, If we are to make the sport more fast-pace, more similar to football, volleyball and basketball, we should bring back the tension by introducing more actions. Instead of freezing players to save them from running, we could promote more movement by allowing players to be in the same zone once the match has started, and only limit their location when they need to make a goal attempt. The last limitation ensures that a player needs to pass the frisbee to a team member when she is too close to the goalkeeper, and with more passes the actions in the arena become more complicated and possibly more exciting to watch. To make the match more intense with more movements, the team size should be much bigger (15+) and the arena should also be big enough to provide some distance between players.\n\nAfter making our prototype, I did some more research on sport and it led me to another perspective. It seems to me that what makes a sport is highly related to people than just the game itself. According to Australian Sports Commission , a sport has to be \"generally accepted as being a sport\". Other keywords than the ones we have included are \"shared and known\", \"rule customs\". There are also a lot of concerns about the social, economical and cultural impact of sports. There are huge communities in most sports with official organisations controlling and developing the sports, where they determining the rules.\n\nFrom this viewpoint, more games can be sports, but what is important is whether such games offer enough interest and room for the participants and the public to share and form organisations to develop them into commonly accepted sports. One important factor is spectatorship because it help spreading the game to a larger audience and allows them to share the experience.\n\nWith this information, I would imagine that if our sport should be more golf-like experience, the factor of success to become a commonly accepted sport would be more focused on internally among participants, and the sport should provide social, lifestyle and well-being enhancement. On the other hand, if our sport should be more fast pace, volleyball like, the importance of spectatorship and the mass public is much higher than in golf."
